# Spa-Retreat-Project

Our Spa retreat project is based on our make believe spa '404GETAWAY'. A group application designed for University Bootcamp.

## User Story

- As a user I want to be able to view the facilities at '404GETAWAY.
- As a user I want to be able to create a secure account.
- As a user I want to be able to log in to my account, edit my details, and see my wishlist.
- As a user I want to be able to view and add treatments to my basket, and checkout securely.
- As a user I want to be able to save treatments to view at a later time in my wishlist.
